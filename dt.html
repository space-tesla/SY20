# Step 1: Open MongoDB    using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the nursery management system
use nursery_management_db

# Step 3: Create collections and insert data for plants, fertilizers, customers, suppliers, and purchases

db.plants.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Rose", type: "Flowering", category: "Outdoor", qty: 100, rating: 4.5 },
  { _id: 2, name: "Tulip", type: "Flowering", category: "Indoor", qty: 200, rating: 4.7 },
  { _id: 3, name: "Creeper", type: "Climbing", category: "Outdoor", qty: 500, rating: 4.3 },
  { _id: 4, name: "Fern", type: "Indoor", category: "Indoor", qty: 150, rating: 4.6 },
  { _id: 5, name: "Sunflower", type: "Flowering", category: "Outdoor", qty: 300, rating: 4.8 }
])

db.customers.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Alice", purchased_plants: [1, 2], app_rating: 5, app_recommendation: "Yes", purchase_date: "2023-10-25" },

  { _id: 2, name: "Blooming Plants", product_supplied: "Creepers", rating: 4.8 }
])

# Step 4: Write the Cypher queries to fetch the required results

# a. List the types of plants from the graph model
db.plants.aggregate([
  { $project: { type: 1 } },
  { $group: { _id: "$type" } }
])

# b. List the popular flowering plants
db.plants.aggregate([
  { $match: { type: "Flowering" } },
  { $sort: { rating: -1 } },
  { $project: { name: 1, rating: 1 } }
])

# c. List the names of plants sold where qty > 500 in the last 2 days
db.plants.aggregate([
  { $match: { qty: { $gt: 500 } } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# d. List the names of suppliers in decreasing order who supply "Creepers"
db.suppliers.aggregate([
  { $match: { product_supplied: "Creepers" } },
  { $sort: { rating: -1 } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB   
exit
